Construction Project Risk Prediction API
========================================

This API provides predictive insights and recommendations for construction projects, including predictions for:

-   **Project Delay**: Estimate the delay in construction based on project parameters.
-   **Cost Overrun**: Predict the probability of cost overrun.
-   **Injury Risk**: Assess injury risks on construction sites.

After making predictions, the API can generate detailed solutions using a language model to mitigate the identified risks.

Features
--------

-   **Predict Delay in Construction Projects**: Receive an estimated delay based on factors like area, height, weather conditions, etc.
-   **Predict Cost Overrun**: Get predictions on possible cost overruns with suggested solutions.
-   **Predict Injury Risk**: Assess the likelihood of injuries based on factors such as working conditions, machine conditions, and primary causes.

Each prediction endpoint also provides recommendations generated by a language model for mitigating the identified risks.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/construction_api.git
    cd construction_api`

2.  **Install required packages**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies using:

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Load the environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

  "solution": "Solution content generated by the LLM..."
}`

Logging and Rate Limiting
-------------------------

-   **Logging**: Logs are configured using a rotating file handler (`app.log`). Logs important events like requests, errors, and internal server issues.
-   **Rate Limiting**: API requests are rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per IP.

Error Handling
--------------

In case of errors, the API returns a structured JSON response with the error message:

**Response**:

json

Copy code

`{
  "error": "Error message"
}`

Ensure the models (`Delay_model.pkl`, `Cost_Overrun_model.pkl`, `Injury_model.pkl`) are present in the root directory as required for predictions.
